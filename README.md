# A3_HeliLandingPractice
Arma 3 - Helicopter Landing Practice Reworked, original by KiloSwiss - Ports to more Maps + minor Adaptations

## What is this Scenario about?

Its a Helicopter Landing Practice. It provides a great way to get familiar with helicopters in arma 3, explore a new terrain or just chill out while listening to some good tunes or your favorite podcast.

## Why the rework?
The original author provided this concept only for Malden and Livonia, but there are many other great Islands in ArmA3 that would provide a great stage for this scenario. Also noticed that the Global Mobilisation Helicopters havent been detected by the Virtual Vehicle Spawner, therefore I wanted to create a compatibility for them.

## How does it Works?

You start the mission, walk to the laptop infront of you, select the helicopter from the menu, it will spawn right in front of the Laptop.

Once in the helicopter, you can request a new LZ (Action Menu) and fly there, and land the helicopter. Repeat.

The LZ's are based of the Terrains Location. Within the location it selects a random spot and checks if there is enough space for the helicopter to land.

In case you hit a tree or end up in a powerline, dont worry - respawn is swift, the helicopter will wait for and is ready to go!

## Future Plans and Ideas
- Add a control to adjust the max distance from player to new Landing Zones. - Flying from one corner of the map to the opposite one can get tiring after a while.
- Add a control to adjust the size of the safe LZ. This way people can easily choose if they would like to dare some tighter landing spots.

- Setup a way to add more challenging, predefined LZ's. 


## Known Issues
- Under certain conditions, the helicopter gets immune to damage.
- Custom placed locations doesnt seem to be detected in the VR Environment? Unsure if its just a bug

## Found a Problem? Suggest a map? Add compat for a modded helicopter? 
Create a new issue, select a template provide all needed information.

I myself am a novice with SQF and coding in general, im happy for everyone who wants to contribute.

## Sharing is Caring
I am happy to keep it like KiloSwiss said it himself:

> I don't mind other people using, modifying or even redistributing their own versions of whatever I upload to the workshop.
> It is there for everyone to use.
> Simply said: Sharing is caring.
> The only thing I ask for is that people give credit to the original author and carry over existing entries that credit other people in the original work. 

That said, the only one thing I'd like to add is the following:
Any improvements to help with some bugs, new features or others, I'd kindly ask to add them to this repsoitory as well, so this scenario can grow and everyone can enjoy.
