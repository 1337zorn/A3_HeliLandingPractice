[h1]Heli Landing Practice Reworked - Scottish Highlands[/h1]

A great way to get familiar and excercise with helicopters in Arma 3, explore a new terrain or just chill out while listening to some good tunes or your favorite podcast.


[h2]Rework[/h2]
Originally, this concept only released for Malden and Livonia, but there are many other great terrains in Arma 3, also the GlobMob DLC Helis havent been detected, defore I decided to start this Rework Project.


[h1]How Does it work?[/h1]
Start the Mission, select a Heli via the Laptop and you're ready to go!

Once in the Helicopter, request a new LZ. Land as close as possible. Repeat.
Tree? Power Line? Dont worry! Respawn is swift and the helicopter will be already waiting for you!
